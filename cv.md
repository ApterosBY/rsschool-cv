3. _I believe that the meaning of human life is to become better and develop. To be strong in spirit and body, then live shows its best side. Now I work at the plant as an engineer, unfortunately I don’t see myself developing there. Having learned about the possibility of learning programming, I decided to study, because I see a great future in this._
